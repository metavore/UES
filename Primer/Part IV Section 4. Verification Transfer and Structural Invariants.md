### Part IV: Correctness and Verification Semantics  
### Section 4: Verification Transfer and Structural Invariants

---

#### 1. Introduction to Cross-Domain Verification

Section IV.3 established that validation chains compose correctly during runtime propagation: if each validation gate operates safely, the whole effect remains safe as it travels across domains. This dynamic reasoning gives us compositional correctness in terms of **flows** and **attestations**.

But not all verification is runtime. Much of what we prove about a system begins in more abstract forms: types, protocols, structural invariants. And these exist in different **semantic domains**—actions, effects, protocols, categories. Thus arises a second challenge:

> **Can verification be reused across these domains without redundant work?**

This section develops the theory of **verification transfer**: the ability to **prove a property once**—in the most natural domain for that reasoning—and **reuse it elsewhere**. We show that if the **structure of transformation** between domains preserves the relevant semantics, then verification results can be transported **with confidence**.

We formalize several types of verification transfer:
- Functorial transfer between actions and effects,
- Bidirectional transfer between protocol specs and effect sequences,
- Verification via attestation propagation through gate chains,
- Compositional transfer across interface groups,
- Temporal verification reuse over time and system evolution.

Each type builds on a common insight:
> Verification transfer is valid if structure is preserved, and the property can be faithfully translated.

---

#### 2. Functorial Verification Transfer

We begin with the most fundamental case: **verification transfer via functors**. The functorial bridge \( F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{E} \) connects the **Action Category**—where pure computations live—to the **Effect Category**, which encodes validated state transitions.

Our question is simple but powerful:
> *If an action satisfies a property \( P \) in the Action Category, does its image under \( F \) satisfy a corresponding property in the Effect Category?*

---

##### 2.1 Property Translation via Functors

> **Definition (Property Translation):**  
Let \( F: \mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_2 \) be a functor between categories. A **property translation** \( \tau \) maps each property \( P_1 \) over objects or morphisms in \( \mathcal{C}_1 \) to a corresponding property \( P_2 = \tau(P_1) \) in \( \mathcal{C}_2 \), such that:
\[
P_1(x) \Rightarrow P_2(F(x))
\]

We denote this relationship as:
\[
P_1 \xrightarrow{F} P_2
\]

This allows us to speak meaningfully about "transferring verification results" across categories.

---

##### 2.2 Functorial Transfer Theorem

> **Theorem 1 (Functorial Transfer):**  
Let \( F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{E} \) be the action-to-effect functor. If \( P_{\mathcal{A}} \xrightarrow{F} P_{\mathcal{E}} \), then:
\[
P_{\mathcal{A}}(a) \Rightarrow P_{\mathcal{E}}(F(a))
\]
for any morphism \( a \in \mathcal{A} \).

**Proof sketch:**  
The proof follows directly from the definition of \( F \), which preserves identity and composition. For structural properties—e.g. type preservation, composition legality, linearity—the translation \( \tau \) can be defined syntactically or semantically. For more complex properties (e.g. side-effect freedom), \( \tau \) may encode domain-specific invariants.

∎

---

##### 2.3 Reverse Functorial Transfer

In some cases, the translation is invertible.

> **Theorem 2 (Reverse Functorial Transfer):**  
Suppose \( e = F(a) \) for some \( a \in \mathcal{A} \), and \( P_{\mathcal{E}} \) is such that \( P_{\mathcal{A}} = \tau^{-1}(P_{\mathcal{E}}) \) exists. Then:
\[
P_{\mathcal{E}}(e) \Rightarrow P_{\mathcal{A}}(a)
\]

This allows reasoning to **flow backward**, useful when verifying the provenance of a generated effect trace.

> **Caveat:** This only applies to effects in the **image of \( F \)**—not all effects arise from pure actions.

---

##### 2.4 Transferable Property Classes

Common classes of properties that support functorial transfer include:

- **Structural Properties**  
  “This action composes associatively” ⇒ “This effect sequence is associative.”

- **Type Safety**  
  “Inputs and outputs match” ⇒ “Resources are preserved and transformed correctly.”

- **Flow Consistency**  
  “No missing outputs” ⇒ “No under-defined resource states.”

- **Error Handling**  
  “All paths return values” ⇒ “All effects emit success or error results.”

Each class defines its own \( \tau \), often embedded in the system’s type, flow, or decoration logic.

---

##### 2.5 Transfer Gaps

> **Definition (Transfer Gap):**  
If a property \( P \) partially transfers—i.e., \( P_{\mathcal{A}}(a) \not\Rightarrow P_{\mathcal{E}}(F(a)) \) without additional assumptions—we say there is a **transfer gap** \( \Gamma \), representing additional verification required in \( \mathcal{E} \).

> **Example:**  
Type correctness in \( \mathcal{A} \) does not guarantee **capability possession** in \( \mathcal{E} \). The latter must be verified separately.

Identifying \( \Gamma \) is key to **minimizing re-verification** while preserving rigor.

---

#### 3. Protocol-Effect Verification Transfer

The **protocol-effect duality** connects **static specifications** (protocols) with **executable behaviors** (effects). This duality is captured by two mappings:
- \( \Phi: \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{E} \): protocols to effects
- \( \Psi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{P} \): effects to protocols

These define a **bidirectional correspondence**, enabling verification to move **between the abstract and the concrete**.

---

##### 3.1 Transfer Theorem for Protocol-Effect Duality

> **Theorem 3 (Protocol-Effect Verification Transfer):**  
Let \( P \in \mathcal{P} \) and \( E = \Phi(P) \in \mathcal{E} \), with properties \( p_P \) and \( p_E = \tau(p_P) \). Then:
\[
p_P(P) \Rightarrow p_E(E)
\quad \text{and} \quad
p_E(E) \Rightarrow p_P(\Psi(E))
\]

This allows verification to occur **where it is most convenient**—in the protocol for design, or in the effect domain for implementation.

---

##### 3.2 Property Classes That Transfer

- **Safety**  
  “No illegal states reachable in protocol” ⇒ “No illegal effect targets.”

- **Liveness**  
  “Final state always reachable” ⇒ “Effect completes under all valid conditions.”

- **Security**  
  “Only authenticated users proceed” ⇒ “Effects require capability to execute.”

- **Resource Management**  
  “All acquired resources are released” ⇒ “Resource lifecycle is balanced.”

---

##### 3.3 Verifying Protocols via Effects

> **Theorem 4 (Effect-Driven Protocol Verification):**  
To verify \( p_P(P) \), one may:
1. Compute \( E = \Phi(P) \)
2. Translate property: \( p_E = \tau(p_P) \)
3. Verify \( p_E(E) \)
4. Conclude \( p_P(P) \) via \( \Psi(E) \cong P \)

This strategy enables **design-level verification** using **runtime representations**, supporting tooling and optimization.

---

#### 4. Verification Transfer Through Gate Chains

In Section IV.3, we modeled **gate chains** as structured morphisms that propagate effects between security domains. Each gate performs validation, possibly transforms the effect, and appends an attestation. Now we ask:

> *Can verification itself be transferred along a gate chain—using attestations as trusted evidence of correctness?*

This subsection formalizes **attestation-based verification transfer** and shows that verification results can propagate through gate chains just like effects, provided trust policies are satisfied.

---

##### 4.1 Attestation-Based Verification

> **Definition (Verification Transfer via Attestation):**  
Let \( G : D_1 \to D_2 \) be a validation gate. Suppose in \( D_1 \), an effect \( e \) satisfies property \( P \), with proof \( \pi \). If:
- \( G(e) = \text{Valid}(e', A) \)
- \( D_2 \)'s policy accepts \( A \) as valid attestation of \( P \)

Then we may derive a verification:
\[
V_{D_2}(e', \tau(P)) \quad \text{(i.e., verification of the transferred effect and property)}
\]

---

##### 4.2 Chain Transfer Theorem

> **Theorem 5 (Gate Chain Verification Transfer):**  
Let \( G = G_n \circ \dots \circ G_1 \) be a gate chain from \( D_0 \to D_n \), and suppose:
- \( V_0(e_0, P_0) \) holds in \( D_0 \)
- \( G(e_0) = \text{Valid}(e_n, [A_1, \dots, A_n]) \)
- \( D_n \)'s trust policy accepts the attestation chain

Then:
\[
V_n(e_n, P_n = \tau(P_0)) \text{ holds in } D_n
\]

**Proof sketch:**  
Follows by induction: each gate validates and emits an attestation \( A_i \), which preserves the property \( \tau(P_{i-1}) \). If the final domain trusts the whole sequence, then it accepts the composite verification.

∎

---

##### 4.3 Trust Policies and Attestation Acceptance

Each domain defines a **trust policy** that determines:
- Which domains may issue attestations,
- Which properties may be transferred,
- Which proofs are accepted as sufficient.

> **Definition (Trust Policy):**  
A trust policy \( T_D \) is a predicate over attestation chains:
\[
T_D : [A_1, \dots, A_n] \mapsto \{\text{Accept, Reject}\}
\]

Policies may enforce:
- **Attestation origin requirements** (e.g., must include validator \( V \)),
- **Chain structure** (e.g., max length, known intermediate domains),
- **Temporal constraints** (e.g., no stale attestations).

---

##### 4.4 Selective Verification Transfer

> **Definition (Selective Transfer Policy):**  
A selective transfer policy \( S_D \) allows a domain to specify:
1. Which **properties** may be verified via attestation,
2. Which must be **verified locally**,
3. What **attestation evidence** is required for each.

This enables **efficient delegation** of verification responsibility. For example:
- Capability constraints may require local check.
- Type safety may be accepted from upstream.
- Resource balancing might be verified at effect origin.

---

#### 5. Group-Based Composition Transfer

In Section III.5, we introduced **group-based interfaces** as composite abstractions over multiple lanes, composed via categorical bundling. Group interfaces are particularly useful when reasoning about **modular system components**.

Here, we show that **verification transfer composes across groups**, provided the property in question is closed under composition.

---

##### 5.1 Property Transfer Over Interface Composition

> **Theorem 6 (Group Composition Transfer):**  
Let \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \) be composable interface groups, and \( P \) be a property such that:
- \( P(G_1) \)
- \( P(G_2) \)
- \( P \) is preserved under composition (i.e., closed)

Then:
\[
P(G_1 \diamond G_2)
\]

**Proof sketch:**  
By the composition rules of decorated PROPs and coherence conditions on bundled morphisms. If each component satisfies \( P \), and the wiring diagram is valid, then so does the composite.

∎

---

##### 5.2 Compositionally Closed Property Classes

Common examples include:
- **Type Consistency**: if each group respects type wiring, so does the composite.
- **Flow Soundness**: if inputs are consumed and outputs produced correctly in each component, the full system is safe.
- **Capability Confinement**: capability boundaries are preserved across interfaces.

---

##### 5.3 Practical Verification Strategies

This compositionality enables:
- **Decomposition**: break a system into smaller, verifiable units.
- **Pattern Libraries**: pre-verify reusable interface groups.
- **Incremental Verification**: only verify changed components and re-compose.

Group-based verification transfer allows large systems to be reasoned about **modularly**, without global re-verification.

---

#### 6. Temporal Verification and Stability

So far, we have considered verification as a static judgment. But in dynamic systems, both **entities** and their **contexts** evolve. A verification performed at time \( t_1 \) must be re-examined at time \( t_2 \).

> The central question is:
> **When does a verification result remain valid over time?**

---

##### 6.1 Temporal Validity

> **Definition (Temporal Verification Validity):**  
Let \( V(e, p, t_1) \) denote verification of property \( p \) on entity \( e \) at time \( t_1 \). We say this remains valid at time \( t_2 \) if:
- \( e \) has not changed in a relevant way,
- The **semantics of \( p \)** remain stable,
- No revocation or policy shift has occurred that would invalidate the judgment.

---

##### 6.2 Theorem: Verification Stability

> **Theorem 7 (Stability Over Time):**  
\[
V(e, p, t_1) \Rightarrow V(e, p, t_2)
\]
if and only if:
\[
\text{Stable}(e, p, t_1, t_2) \wedge \text{StableContext}(e, p, t_1, t_2)
\]

**Proof sketch:**  
The verification is a function of the internal and external state of \( e \). If none of the dependencies in this computation have changed, the result is still sound.

∎

---

##### 6.3 Dependency Tracking

Each verification may depend on:
- Internal state of \( e \) (e.g., type, resources, flow),
- Environmental conditions (e.g., active policies, trust anchors),
- External references (e.g., capabilities, protocol versions).

These are formalized as a **dependency set** \( D(e, p) \). Verification remains valid as long as \( D \) is unchanged.

---

##### 6.4 Versioned Verification

Many systems include **version identifiers** and **timestamps** with their verification records:
```rust
struct VersionedVerification {
    entity_id: EntityId,
    property_id: PropertyId,
    version: VersionVector,
    timestamp: Time,
    proof: VerificationProof,
    dependencies: Hash
}
```

This enables:
- Efficient cache validation,
- Incremental re-verification,
- Temporal trust auditing.

---

#### 7. Optimization Techniques for Verification Transfer

Once verification transfer is formalized, we can begin to optimize it—not just *that* verification transfers, but *how efficiently* it does so. This subsection outlines practical strategies to minimize redundant work, improve cache reuse, and reduce verification overhead.

---

##### 7.1 Memoization and Caching

> **Definition (Verification Memoization):**  
A system memoizes verification if it:
1. Records a successful verification \( V(e, p) \),
2. Associates it with a stable version of \( e \),
3. Reuses that verification result if the dependencies remain unchanged.

This avoids recomputation when entities or properties are revisited.

In distributed systems, **memoized results** can be transferred—if the recipient trusts the source domain and the associated proof.

---

##### 7.2 Sliced Verification

> **Definition (Verification Slicing):**  
Verification slicing assigns **responsibility** for verifying each property to a specific domain or component:
- Type correctness ⇒ verified in the Action Category.
- Capability constraints ⇒ checked in each Gate.
- Resource balancing ⇒ verified at effect origin.

Other domains may then **reuse** or **defer to** those verifications via transfer mechanisms.

This division of labor enables **parallelism**, **incremental recomputation**, and **reuse of domain-specialized logic**.

---

##### 7.3 Incremental Verification

When systems evolve, **not all verifications must be redone**.

> **Strategy:** Track which properties depend on which parts of a system. When a change occurs:
- Identify the affected dependency graph.
- Recompute only impacted verifications.
- Retain valid proofs for unaffected paths.

Combined with memoization and slicing, this yields a highly scalable system for real-world evolution.

---

##### 7.4 Trust-Aware Verification Delegation

Trust topologies can be used to **route verification responsibility**.

> **Theorem 8 (Trust-Based Delegation):**  
Let domain \( D_1 \) trust domain \( D_2 \) for a class of properties \( \mathcal{P} \). Then for any property \( p \in \mathcal{P} \):
- If \( V_2(e, p) \) holds and is attested,
- \( D_1 \) may derive \( V_1(e, p) \) without local verification.

This reduces duplication and allows **verification to follow trust**.

---

#### 8. Unification of Transfer Mechanisms

Despite their variety, all the mechanisms presented in this section share a common structure. They can be viewed as **structure-preserving transformations** over verification domains.

---

##### 8.1 The Generalized Transfer Theorem

> **Theorem 9 (Generalized Verification Transfer):**  
Let \( T: X \to Y \) be a structure-preserving transformation between verification domains, and let:
- \( p_X \) be a property over domain \( X \),
- \( p_Y = \tau(p_X) \) be the translated property over domain \( Y \),
- \( T \) preserve the relevant semantics of \( p_X \),

Then:
\[
p_X(e) \Rightarrow p_Y(T(e))
\]

**Examples of \( T \):**
- A functor between categories (e.g., actions → effects)
- A protocol-to-effect mapping (Φ)
- A gate chain (via attestation semantics)
- A time shift (version tracking)
- A group composition (interface aggregation)

**Proof sketch:**  
Each of these transformations maintains structural properties and defines a corresponding \( \tau \). The general theorem holds when the preservation conditions are met.

∎

---

##### 8.2 A Category of Verification Domains

We can now describe verification transfer abstractly:
- **Objects**: Verification domains (e.g., Action Category, Protocol Domain, Effect Category, Time Index)
- **Morphisms**: Structure-preserving transformations (e.g., functors, Φ/Ψ, gate chains)
- **Composition**: Chained transfer (e.g., protocol → effect → time shift)

This structure forms a **category**, where reasoning about verification becomes **graph-theoretic**—moving verification proofs through networks of semantic transformations.

---

##### 8.3 The Verification Transfer Lattice

Just as trust formed a lattice (Section IV.3), verification domains and transfer paths form a **lattice of verifiability**. This provides:
- Global views of reachable verifications,
- Partial orderings of abstraction,
- Join operations for reconverging semantics.

The result is a scalable, formal map of **what can be verified where, and how**.

---

#### 9. Conclusion: Structure-Preserving Proof Semantics

This section extended the compositional reasoning of Section IV.3 into the realm of **pattern-level verification**. Where Section IV.3 asked *how correctness flows*, this section answered *how correctness can be reused*.

We showed that verification need not be repeated in every domain. If properties and transformations are **structurally compatible**, then verification can be:

- **Transferred across categories** (e.g., actions to effects),
- **Mapped from abstract specs to concrete traces** (protocol-effect duality),
- **Propagated via attestation chains** (gate validation),
- **Composed across modular interfaces** (group objects),
- **Maintained over time** (temporal stability),
- **Optimized via delegation** (trust-aware policies and slicing).

These results form the **foundation for cross-domain reasoning** in the UES. Together with runtime semantics (Section IV.3), they define a full theory of **composable, transferable, and audit-friendly verification** in decentralized systems.

In Part V, we will extend this reasoning to **Pattern–Flow lifting**, showing how abstract, reusable flow patterns can be instantiated as concrete effect executions—retaining their verified properties and correctness guarantees.
