### Part IV: Correctness and Verification Semantics
### Section 3: Validation Chains and Effect Propagation

---

#### 1. Motivation and Context

In earlier sections, we introduced **validation gates** as structured morphisms between security domains. Each gate determines whether an effect can cross a boundary, transforms it according to local policy, and emits an **attestation** to record the outcome. In Section IV.2, we explored how these gates form topologies of trust across systems—where effects propagate through a directed graph of domains and validations.

This section builds upon that foundation to address a deeper question:  
> *If each local validation gate enforces correctness, can we conclude that the entire chain of effect propagation is also correct?*

In other words, does **correctness compose**?

To answer this, we develop a formal account of how **validation chains** behave when composed, including success, failure, transformation, and proof generation. We treat these chains as morphisms in a **Kleisli-enriched category**, where each gate may return success or failure along with structured evidence. This lets us reason about correctness not just in isolation, but across **multi-domain journeys**, including those with **branching paths**, **reconverging flows**, and **revocable or expiring validations**.

The result is a semantics of **proof-carrying effect propagation**: correctness is not global by fiat—it is assembled, locally, as an attested composite.

---

#### 2. Formal Preliminaries: End-to-End Gate Chains

Let \( \mathcal{V}^{\mathcal{K}} \) denote the **Kleisli category** of validation gates. Its:

- **Objects** are security domains \( D_0, D_1, \dots \), each with its own validation policy.
- **Morphisms** are total functions of the form:
  \[
  G_i : \text{Effect}_{D_{i-1}} \rightarrow \mathcal{V}(\text{Effect}_{D_i})
  \]
  where \( \mathcal{V} \) is the **validation monad**, defined by:
  \[
  \mathcal{V}(X) := 
  \begin{cases}
  \text{Valid}(x', p) & \text{if accepted, with attestation} \\
  \text{Invalid}(r, q) & \text{if rejected, with reason and rejection proof}
  \end{cases}
  \]

Given a sequence of validation gates:
\[
G_1 : D_0 \to \mathcal{V}(D_1), \quad 
G_2 : D_1 \to \mathcal{V}(D_2), \quad 
\dots, \quad 
G_n : D_{n-1} \to \mathcal{V}(D_n)
\]
we define the composite morphism:
\[
G = G_n \circ \dots \circ G_1 : D_0 \to \mathcal{V}(D_n)
\]
as a **validation chain**.

This composition is **monadic**—it short-circuits on failure, and accumulates attestations along successful paths. These attestations form a **chain of trust**, which downstream validators and auditors can verify independently.

We now turn to the central theorem of this section: that successful validation at each link in a chain implies the correctness of the entire sequence.

---

#### 3. The Global Composition Theorem

> **Theorem 1 (Validation Chain Composition)**  
> Let \( G_1, \dots, G_n \) be a chain of validation gates as above. Let \( e_0 \in \text{Effect}_{D_0} \) be an initial effect. Then:
>
> \[
> G_n \circ \dots \circ G_1(e_0) = \text{Valid}(e_n, p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n)
> \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
> \forall i,\ G_i(e_{i-1}) = \text{Valid}(e_i, p_i)
> \]
>
> That is, an effect is globally valid if and only if each local gate accepts and transforms it, producing an attestation \( p_i \). The full attestation chain \( p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n \) records the complete validation path.

**Proof (by induction):**

- **Base case (n = 1):** Trivially holds by the definition of gate \( G_1 \).
- **Inductive step:**  
  Assume the theorem holds for chains of length \( n-1 \). Consider the chain \( G = G_n \circ \dots \circ G_1 \), and suppose:
  \[
  G_{n-1} \circ \dots \circ G_1(e_0) = \text{Valid}(e_{n-1}, p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_{n-1})
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  G_n(e_{n-1}) = \text{Valid}(e_n, p_n)
  \]
  Then by Kleisli composition:
  \[
  G(e_0) = G_n(e_{n-1}) = \text{Valid}(e_n, p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n)
  \]
  The converse follows by inspection of the composed success structure.

∎

---

**Corollary 1 (Auditability):**  
The composite attestation \( p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n \) may be verified independently by any downstream party, enabling decentralized auditing of correctness.

**Corollary 2 (Modular Security):**  
If each gate enforces a property \( P_i \), then the final effect satisfies the conjunction:
\[
P_1 \land P_2 \land \dots \land P_n
\]
This establishes a compositional security model: correctness is accumulated one domain at a time.

---

#### 4. Branching and Convergence

So far, we have considered validation chains as linear sequences of domains. However, real systems often involve **parallel propagation** of effects—where a single effect **branches** to multiple domains, and later **reconverges** for aggregation or final resolution.

This subsection formalizes how correctness composes in such **non-linear topologies**, including how multiple attestation paths can be merged, and what conditions must hold for convergence to be valid.

---

##### 4.1 Branching Paths

> **Definition (Branching Flow):**  
Given an effect \( e \in \text{Effect}_{D_0} \), a branching flow is a set of independent validation chains:
\[
\{ G^{(i)} = G_1^{(i)} \circ \dots \circ G_{k_i}^{(i)} \}_{i=1}^n
\]
Each chain validates \( e \), producing transformed effect \( e^{(i)} \) and attestation chain \( p^{(i)} \). The result is a **multiset of parallel validations**:
\[
\{ (e^{(i)}, p^{(i)}) \}_{i=1}^n
\]

These branches represent **independent validations**: the success or failure of one branch does not affect the others.

---

##### 4.2 Convergence

> **Definition (Effect Convergence):**  
Let \( \{ e^{(i)} \} \) be a set of validated effects converging at domain \( D \). A **convergence gate** \( G_\cap \) operates as:
\[
G_\cap : (e^{(1)}, \dots, e^{(n)}) \rightarrow \mathcal{V}(e^\star)
\]
To succeed, the convergence gate must:
1. Verify each attestation \( p^{(i)} \),
2. Ensure the effects are **compatible** under a reconciliation predicate \( R \),
3. Emit a new effect \( e^\star \) with a composite attestation.

> **Lemma (Soundness of Converged Validation):**  
If each branch \( G^{(i)}(e) = \text{Valid}(e^{(i)}, p^{(i)}) \) and \( R(e^{(1)}, \dots, e^{(n)}) \) holds, then:
\[
G_\cap(e^{(1)}, \dots, e^{(n)}) = \text{Valid}(e^\star, p_\cap)
\]
where \( p_\cap \) includes all \( p^{(i)} \) plus the reconciliation attestation.

This gives a **constructive correctness rule**: convergence is valid if and only if all inputs are valid and jointly satisfiable.

---

##### 4.3 Partial Failure

If any branch fails (i.e., \( G^{(i)}(e) = \text{Invalid}(\cdot) \)), then:
- The convergence gate may still succeed if its policy allows **quorum-based acceptance**, **graceful degradation**, or **fallback merging**.
- Otherwise, it must reject with an aggregated rejection proof.

> **Pattern Examples:**
- **All-or-nothing merge**: Requires all branches to succeed.
- **Threshold quorum**: Requires at least \( t \) of \( n \) branches to validate.
- **Trusted-majority policy**: Prioritizes certain branches over others.

The branching model enhances expressive power, while the convergence rules ensure that **global correctness still composes**, even in non-linear topologies.

---

#### 5. Partial Knowledge and Local Views

In decentralized systems, no domain has global visibility of the full trust topology. Each domain must make validation decisions using only its **local knowledge**.

This subsection formalizes **local topology views**, and proves that **end-to-end correctness can still be validated locally**, under appropriate policy assumptions.

---

##### 5.1 Local Topology View

> **Definition (Local View):**  
For a domain \( D \), its local topology view is the subgraph:
\[
\mathcal{T}_D = (D, G_D, C_D)
\]
where:
- \( G_D \subseteq \text{Gates} \): known inbound/outbound gates
- \( C_D \): the capability requirements or trust conditions associated with those gates

Every domain always knows at least:
- Its **direct neighbors**,
- The **gates it owns or operates**,
- Any attestation chains presented to it.

---

##### 5.2 Verifiable Prefixes

When an effect \( e \) arrives at domain \( D \), it carries an attestation chain \( p = p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n \). The domain may not recognize all of \( p \), but if it recognizes a **prefix**:
\[
p_{1..k} = p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_k
\]
that satisfies its policy, it may accept \( e \) without inspecting the full chain.

> **Theorem (Local Verification Sufficiency):**  
If a domain \( D \) has a trust policy \( T \), and:
\[
T(p_{1..k}) = \text{Accept}
\]
then the domain may accept \( e \) without requiring the full chain \( p \), provided the suffix does not violate any rejection criteria.

This enables **bounded trust scopes**, **delegated authority**, and **introduction-based validation**.

---

##### 5.3 k-Locality and Trust Horizons

Define the **k-locality** of a domain as:
\[
\mathcal{L}_k(D) = \{ D' \mid \text{reachable from } D \text{ in } \leq k \text{ hops} \}
\]
Many practical policies operate only over \( \mathcal{L}_1 \) or \( \mathcal{L}_2 \), enabling **efficient local validation** without global traversal.

> **Design pattern:**  
- Accept attestations from domains in \( \mathcal{L}_1 \)
- Require introductions from domains in \( \mathcal{L}_2 \)
- Reject unknown roots or ambiguous chains

---

#### 6. Selective Disclosure and Proof Minimization

In trust propagation, **not all domains need to see all attestations**. To reduce bandwidth, protect privacy, and improve scalability, the UES supports **selective disclosure** of attestation chains.

---

##### 6.1 Selective Disclosure

> **Definition:**  
A selectively disclosed attestation chain \( p' \subseteq p \) is a projection of the full chain, including only the attestations required by the recipient’s policy.

This projection is:
- Determined by the policy of the **target domain**,
- Enforced by the **sender or intermediary**,
- Verified using existing attestation semantics.

> **Theorem (Minimal Disclosure Soundness):**  
Let \( D \)'s policy require a predicate \( P \) over attestations. If:
\[
P(p') = \text{Accept}
\]
then the recipient may accept the effect, even if \( p \setminus p' \) is undisclosed, assuming no red flags are raised.

---

##### 6.2 Forwarding and Attestation Reduction

Selective disclosure is especially important for:
- **Multi-hop routing** (where intermediate domains do not need full history),
- **Cross-organizational federation** (where privacy or legal constraints apply),
- **Audit-layer separation** (e.g., splitting logic from recordkeeping).

Senders may:
- Redact non-essential attestations,
- Replace subsets with **attestation digests** or **Merkle proofs**,
- Use **zero-knowledge summaries** (optional future work).

---

With these three subsections complete, we’ve now expanded the base case (linear validation) into a much richer dynamic semantics:
- Effects may flow through **branching paths**, be validated under **partial trust views**, and carry **minimized proofs**.
- Validation remains correct, auditable, and composable across all these cases.


---

#### 7. Revocation and Dynamic Validation

In real systems, trust is not permanent. Capabilities expire, validators are compromised, and policy constraints evolve. The Unified Effect System supports **dynamic revalidation** through a formal treatment of **revocation**.

This subsection defines revocation as a first-class effect, explains how it integrates with validation chains, and formalizes how systems respond when attestations become invalid retroactively.

---

##### 7.1 Revocation as an Effect

> **Definition (Revocation Effect):**  
A revocation is modeled as a special effect:
\[
\text{Revoke}(x, \text{scope}, \text{reason}, t)
\]
Where:
- \( x \): the entity being revoked (e.g. gate, domain, capability)
- \( \text{scope} \): which domains or flows are affected
- \( \text{reason} \): structured metadata (e.g., "compromised key")
- \( t \): timestamp or logical validity window

Like any effect, revocation must itself be validated and attested. It is typically issued by a trusted authority (e.g., a root domain or policy manager), and may propagate alongside or independently of regular effect flows.

---

##### 7.2 Expiring Capabilities

Capabilities may include:
- **Time-bounded validity**
- **Scope constraints**
- **Revocation conditions (e.g., after one use, or upon failure)**

Validation gates must check the temporal and contextual validity of incoming capabilities before admitting effects. These constraints ensure that **replay attacks** and **stale validations** cannot subvert the system.

---

##### 7.3 Validation Reactivity

> **Principle (Reactive Consistency):**  
Let \( e \in \text{Effect} \), and let \( p = p_1 \cdot \dots \cdot p_n \) be its attestation chain. If a new revocation invalidates any \( p_i \), then \( e \) must be marked as invalid, and:
- Future validators will reject it,
- Dependent effects must be revalidated,
- The revocation must appear in audit records.

This is analogous to **dependency invalidation** in build systems or logic solvers.

---

##### 7.4 Proof Inversion and Rejection Semantics

Upon revocation, the system must:
1. Trace which effects depended on the invalidated attestation,
2. Propagate invalidation (forward or backward),
3. Record the change with an updated rejection proof.

> **Example (proof chain breakage):**  
If \( e = \text{Valid}(e', p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3) \), and \( p_2 \) is later revoked, then \( e \) is transformed into:
\[
\text{Invalid}(r, p_1 \cdot q_2)
\]
Where \( q_2 \) is the rejection attestation explaining the revocation of \( p_2 \).

This enables **accountable failure semantics**, where rejection is not silent but becomes a structured artifact of the system.

---

#### 8. Trust Lattice Optimizations

In large trust topologies, redundancy is inevitable. Multiple gate paths may validate the same effect. Domains may trust overlapping sets of validators. To manage this complexity, the UES introduces **trust lattices**—structured partial orders that enable optimization of effect propagation.

---

##### 8.1 Trust as a Partial Order

Let \( D \) be the set of security domains. Define a relation:
\[
D_i \sqsubseteq D_j \iff \text{every validator trusted by } D_i \text{ is also trusted by } D_j
\]

Then:
- The **join** \( D_i \sqcup D_j \): least upper bound (union of trusted validators)
- The **meet** \( D_i \sqcap D_j \): greatest lower bound (intersection)

This forms a **trust lattice**. Domains can reason about **minimal sufficient attestation sets** based on their position in this structure.

---

##### 8.2 Attestation Minimization

> **Theorem (Trust Join Minimization):**  
Let \( D \) trust both \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \). If \( p_1 \sqsubseteq p_2 \), then only \( p_1 \) need be presented to satisfy \( D \)'s trust policy.

This enables:
- **Proof compression** (fewer attestations),
- **Validation shortcuts** (reuse of trusted intermediaries),
- **Policy-based skipping** of redundant verification.

---

##### 8.3 Gate Equivalence and Coalescing

Multiple gates may enforce **identical policies**. Define:
\[
G_a \sim G_b \iff \text{Same constraints, same effect transformation, same attestation semantics}
\]

Such gates are **interchangeable**. Composed paths using them may be **collapsed** or **rewritten** to simplify attestation paths and reduce system load.

> **Optimization Pattern:**  
Cache equivalence classes of gates or validators. During effect propagation, coalesce attestation chains where the underlying semantics are proven equivalent.

---

##### 8.4 Verifier Indexing and Routing

Each domain may maintain a **trusted verifier index**, annotated by:
- Capability class
- Property type
- Gate compatibility

This supports **trust-aware routing**, in which effect validation requests are dynamically directed to **optimal or preferred** validators.

---

#### 9. Conclusion and Further Directions

This section has constructed a full operational semantics for effect validation in decentralized systems. The key result is that **correctness composes**—as long as each gate in a validation chain enforces its local policy and produces attestable proof.

We extended this model from simple chains to:
- **Branching topologies**
- **Reconvergent flows**
- **Partial visibility and local reasoning**
- **Dynamic revocation**
- **Attestation minimization via trust lattices**

The result is a decentralized yet compositional model of security: effects propagate through trust networks, accumulate proof, and either succeed or fail in ways that are **provable, inspectable, and audit-friendly**.

In the next section, we will shift perspective. Instead of asking *whether correctness composes as effects move*, we ask *whether correctness transfers as structures shift*. There, we formalize **property transfer**, **pattern-level reasoning**, and **category-theoretic alignment** between domains—extending verification from dynamic behavior to abstract structure.
