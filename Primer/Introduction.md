# Preface:

Please note that this is the unvetted madness of a math teacher with no CS background and too much trust in LLMs, working in secret for many months. Take it all with a cup of salt.

The original goal was making a system for safe AI containment that could also protect the AI from each other upon interacting. That led to some specific architectural choices; the separation of composable "actions" from protected "resources".

In order to address the risk of side-channel attacks, I introduced Capability-based security, and integrating that into a structure-driven resource management system and execution environment made more sense when I broke it off into a separate project, Capillary.

But that project just had too much theory, so I pulled it out and this explosion of concepts took on a life of its own. Now Capillary is set to be the reference implementation of UES. Hopefully, this will make *that* documentation much easier to read! I did my best to remove all useful code from this document.

# The Unified Effect System: Executive Summary

## A New Approach to System Security and Component Interaction

The Unified Effect System (UES) introduces a cohesive framework for reasoning about system behavior, security, and component interaction. It addresses a fundamental challenge in software design: how can we enable rich interactions between components without requiring them to fully trust each other? Or more pointedly: how can we let two pieces of code work together productively while keeping each safe from the other's potential misbehavior?

## The Central Insights: Unifying Traditionally Separate Concerns

The UES builds on two fundamental insights:

First, **structure itself can embody capability**‚Äîthe connectivity patterns between components inherently define what operations are possible without requiring complex contracts. When we control how things connect, we control what can happen, creating security through topology rather than through permission lists.

Second, **traditionally separate concerns share a common structure**. Resource operations, security boundary crossings, and protocol sequences are all manifestations of the same underlying concept: controlled state changes, which we call **effects**. An effect represents a controlled system state change with:

- Explicit type and target specification
- Required capabilities for authorization
- Constraints that must be satisfied
- Proof generation for verification

By recognizing this unity, we gain a common language for reasoning about all state-changing operations, whether they modify resources, cross boundaries, or advance protocols.

## The Surprising Theoretical Foundation

What began as a practical attempt to secure component interactions unexpectedly led to deep mathematical connections. The UES is built on:

- **The Dual-Category Framework**: A mathematical structure that connects pure actions (what happens) to effects (how it happens) through a structure-preserving functor. This bridge allows verification in whichever domain is most convenient.

- **Protocol-Effect Duality**: A bidirectional mapping between static interaction templates (protocols) and dynamic state changes (effects), resolving the traditional separation between design-time specification and runtime execution.

- **Capability Security Semantics**: A model of authority and interaction based on *possession*, not identity. Capabilities are unforgeable tokens of authority that determine what operations are possible. By aligning connectivity with possession, UES ensures that access control is enforced structurally, not through ambient policy.

- **Linear Logic Integration**: A resource-sensitive logic that aligns perfectly with capability security, ensuring resources are used exactly once unless explicitly marked as shareable. These two concepts are the secret ingredients to the special sauce.

- **Validation Gates**: A rigorous formalization of security boundaries where effects are verified, transformed, and attested as they cross domains, with failure treated as a first-class, provable outcome.

## Practical Impact

This theoretical framework yields practical benefits for system design:

### Unified Security Model

- All state changes require explicit capabilities
- Boundaries have formal verification guarantees
- Attestations provide proof of correct behavior
- Composition preserves security properties

### Cross-Domain Interaction

- Components can interact without full mutual trust
- Validation gates enforce domain-specific policies
- Trust paths accumulate verifiable evidence
- Rejection is meaningful and attestable

### Resource Management

- Resources have clear, controlled lifecycles
- Authorization follows explicit paths
- Capability delegation follows formal rules
- Composition respects resource constraints

## Applications and Future Directions

The UES addresses fundamental challenges in multiple domains:

- **Mutually Suspicious Cooperation**: Enabling components to work together productively without requiring them to fully trust each other
- **Cross-Domain Verification**: Propagating effects across security boundaries while maintaining formal guarantees
- **Decentralized Trust**: Building systems where trust emerges from composition of local judgments rather than central authority
- **Secure Protocol Implementation**: Systematically translating protocol specifications to executable effects with preserved properties

Future research directions include distributed effect systems, probabilistic and timed extensions, automated optimization, and domain-specific pattern libraries.

In essence, the Unified Effect System provides a framework where composition, security, and verification are integrated aspects of the same underlying mathematical structure, rather than separate concerns bolted together. This integration enables systems that are secure by construction, verifiable by composition, and trustworthy by design.
